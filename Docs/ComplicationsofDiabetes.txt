Complications of diabetes are serious, long-term health problems caused by high blood sugar damaging blood vessels and nerves, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage (neuropathy), and eye problems. Other complications include foot problems, increased risk of infections, and skin and oral conditions. However, many complications can be prevented or delayed by managing blood sugar levels through healthy lifestyle choices and regular medical care. 
Cardiovascular & Blood Vessel Complications 
Heart Disease and Stroke:
Diabetes increases the risk of atherosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels), heart attacks, and strokes. 
Peripheral Artery Disease:
Poor blood flow to the legs and feet can lead to ulcers and may require amputation. 
Nerve Damage (Diabetic Neuropathy) 
Pain and Sensation Loss:
Nerves in the arms and legs can be damaged, causing pain, burning, tingling, and loss of feeling. 
Digestive Issues:
Nerves in the digestive system can be damaged, leading to problems with digestion, constipation, diarrhea, or nausea. 
Sexual and Bladder Problems:
Nerves and blood flow in the genitals and bladder can be affected, leading to sexual dysfunction and bladder issues. 
Kidney Disease (Diabetic Nephropathy) 
Reduced Kidney Function:
Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, which can impair their ability to filter blood.
Kidney Failure:
In severe cases, this can lead to end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Eye Problems
Diabetic Retinopathy: Damage to the blood vessels in the eyes can lead to vision loss or blindness. 
Other Eye Conditions: Diabetes also increases the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. 
Other Complications
Foot Problems: Nerve damage and poor circulation can cause foot ulcers and infections, potentially leading to amputation. 
Increased Risk of Infections: Diabetes can weaken the immune system, making people more prone to skin, urinary tract, and mouth infections. 
Skin and Oral Health: People with diabetes are more susceptible to certain skin conditions, gum disease, dry mouth, and other oral problems. 
Hearing Impairment: Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. 
Sleep Apnea: Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people with type 2 diabetes. 
How to Prevent or Delay Complications
