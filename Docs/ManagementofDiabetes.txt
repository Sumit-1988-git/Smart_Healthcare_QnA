Diabetes management centers on healthy lifestyle choices—including a balanced diet and regular physical activity—and medical treatments like insulin or other medications, as well as monitoring blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin therapy for life, while Type 2 diabetes may be managed through diet, exercise, weight management, and oral medications, though insulin may also be necessary. Managing blood pressure and cholesterol, and getting adequate sleep are also crucial components of diabetes care to prevent complications. 
Lifestyle Management
Diet:
Choose healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and limit saturated fats and processed foods. 
Physical Activity:
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking) and two days of muscle-strengthening activities per week. 
Healthy Weight:
Losing even 7% of your body weight if overweight can significantly improve blood sugar control in prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. 
Sleep:
Get 7-8 hours of sleep per night, as it can improve mood, energy levels, and blood glucose control. 
Medical Management
Medications:
Type 1 diabetes always requires insulin. Many people with Type 2 diabetes may also need medications, including oral pills or injectable medicines, like insulin, to help manage blood sugar. 
Blood Sugar Monitoring:
Regularly tracking blood sugar levels is essential to understand how diet, exercise, and medication affect you. 
Other Health Conditions:
Managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels is vital to prevent complications like heart disease. 
Essential Tools & Practices
Diabetes Education:
Learn about diabetes from a healthcare professional or diabetes educator to understand your condition and how to manage it effectively. 
Regular Check-ups:
See your healthcare team regularly to adjust your treatment plan, monitor for any complications, and check your feet for any signs of neuropathy. 
Quit Tobacco and Limit Alcohol:
Quitting tobacco and avoiding excessive alcohol intake can reduce health risks associated with diabetes. 
For Type 1 Diabetes
Insulin therapy is required for survival. 
Various types of insulin are available, including short-acting, rapid-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting forms. 
For Type 2 Diabetes
A combination of lifestyle changes and medications (like metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or others) may be necessary. 
Weight loss is a critical component of management for those who are overweight. 
Key takeaway: A holistic approach involving a healthy lifestyle, appropriate medications, regular monitoring, and strong support from a healthcare team is key to effective diabetes management and preventing serious complications.
